This is the store where I sell my mods (mostly Zen Cart).

Live Site: <http://www.thatsoftwareguy.com/store>

## Tools
* [Zen Cart](http://www.zencart.com)

## Story
For years, I would distribute software manually.  I'd get a payment
and then email the software, either from my desktop or from my
Blackberry.  Why didn't I use Zen Cart?  I know, it seems crazy.
Honestly, I was just too busy building sites for other people to build
my own.

My friend [David Croy](http://www.doubledogsoftware.com), and later,
a client named 
[Adrian Frankel](http://calliopesclosets.com.au/) encouraged me
to set up an online store, and finally I did.
