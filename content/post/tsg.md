This is my business website.  I've been doing 
[Zen Cart](http://www.zencart.com)
modifications (and also working with a handful of other carts) 
since 2006.

Live Site: <http://www.thatsoftwareguy.com>

## Tools
* [Bootstrap] (http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Ericka Template] (https://www.behance.net/gallery/5842843/Ericka-Responsive-Bootstrap-Template)

## Story
For years I had a static HTML site designed for desktops.
Here's what the old site looked like:

In 2013, I finally updated my site to use Twitter Boostrap 3 
so it could be easily viewed on mobile devices.  

It's a blog style website, but for some unknown reason, I was 
never tempted to use actual blogging software like Wordpress. 
Go figure. 

I loved the Ericka template, but like many templates, it was built 
for small websites.  My site has almost 200 pages 
- see [sitemap](http://www.thatsoftwareguy.com/sitemap.html) - so I really wanted to use Server Side Includes
(SSI) and consolidate the common code. I wound up slicing the
template up into chunks (38 partial files at the time of writing),
and rebuilding the pages out of these partials.
