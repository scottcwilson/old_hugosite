I'm just getting started with [Shopify](https://app.shopify.com/services/signup/?ref=thatsoftwareguy).  I built a little demo shop so 
people can see what using a Shopify store is like.

## Tools
* [Shopify] (https://app.shopify.com/services/signup/?ref=thatsoftwareguy)
* [Liquid] (http://shopify.github.io/liquid/)

## Story
Shopify does not offer as much customizability as Zen Cart, but 
if you're not a software developer (or don't have access to low-cost help), TCO
will likely wind up up being lower.   It depends on whether this 
trade off makes sense for you.  For shops that need a lot of business logic
to drive the customer workflow, or shops that have a complex supply chain, 
Shopify might not work, but if your store 
is simple and doesn't have a lot of rules, it's worth trying out.
