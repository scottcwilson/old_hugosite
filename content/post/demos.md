I have so many 
[Zen Cart](http://www.zencart.com)
mods that I need <s>three</s> four demo stores 
to show them all!  I also host an osCommerce demo site because some
of my mods have been posted to that platform.

## Tools
* [Bootstrap] (http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Ericka Template] (https://www.behance.net/gallery/5842843/Ericka-Responsive-Bootstrap-Template)

## Story
Some of my modifications overlap each other, so I really had to 
create multiple sites to show off all of them.  I wound up 
using one of 
[Picaflor Azul's] (https://www.picaflor-azul.com/)
many templates - the one I settled on was 
[Responsive Sheffield Blue]
(https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1744).
