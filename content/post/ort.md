## Story
I maintained this site just by editing HTML for many years. I wanted
to do something more sophisticated, but never seemed to get around to it.
One day, though, I noticed that some of my old Amazon-generated links 
were no longer working.  Rather than going through and testing them all,
I decided to completely rebuild the site using Amazon's API, so I could 
be guaranteed of getting good URLs.

A long time ago, I did a proof of concept using 
Postgres and Rails that you can see [on Heroku](http://tampabaybookgroup.herokuapp.com/), but this seemed like overkill for such a small site.  
So I just had to choose between a couple of static site generators that
I was familiar with - [Hugo] (https://gohugo.io/) and Jekyll.  
I had always wanted to learn more Ruby, so I chose Jekyll.
