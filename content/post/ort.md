This is my book group website.  We have been reading together for 
more than ten years. 

Live Site: <http://tampabaybookgroup.org>

## Tools
* Static HTML
* Images served via Amazon using the Affiliate link builder.

## Story
I have maintained this site just by editing HTML for many years.
I have often thought about taking a more sophisticated approach, 
but I have never taken the leap.  For example, I did an implementation
of this using Postgres and Rails that you can see [on Heroku](http://tampabaybookgroup.herokuapp.com/). Who knows - someday maybe.
