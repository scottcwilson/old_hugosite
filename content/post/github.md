This is my Hugo-based site on Github.

Live Site: <http://scottcwilson.github.io>

## Tools
* [Hugo] (http://gohugo.io/)
* [Aglaus Theme] (https://github.com/dim0627/hugo_theme_aglaus)
* [ShrinkTheWeb] (http://www.shrinktheweb.com/)
* [Markdown Pro] (http://www.markdownpro.com/)
* [Github] (http://www.github.com/)

Source for this website: <https://github.com/scottcwilson/hugosite>

The [hugosite repo readme](https://github.com/scottcwilson/hugosite/blob/master/README.md)
describes how I publish the blog.
I think my technique is much easier than the one described in
[the Hugo documentation](http://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/).
